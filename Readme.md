# Features

## JSX

We support JSX for both React and Preact. We decide which JSX pragma we use based on the imports of the file. If you import from `react` we will transform JSX to `React.createElement`. If you import from `preact` we tranform JSX to `h`. Otherwise we will disable all JSX transforms.

## Automatic Node Package Installation

As soon as you import a package from NPM we will download it for you so you don't have to care about this. We also install peer dependencies so nothing is missing.

## Babel Macros

We support babel-macros out of the box. Feel free to use them.

# Templates

We currently have templates for React, Preact and styled-components. We try to keep the templates as simple as possible because nobody wants to delete code they don't need.

You can override the existing templates or create a new template in your `~/.playgrounds/templates` directory. Create a new directory with the template name and put everything there you want. Then you can use the template with `playgorunds --template <template-name>`.
